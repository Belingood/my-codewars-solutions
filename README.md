# Python Muscle Memory: Codewars Solutions

![Codewars Badge](https://www.codewars.com/users/Belingood/badges/large)

## 🎯 The Purpose
In the age of LLMs, the "muscle memory" of writing syntax and remembering method signatures often fades. This repository is a dedicated space for **Active Recall** and **Deliberate Practice**.

The goal is to transition from being a "Prompt Engineer" back to being a "Fluent Coder," ensuring that the core Python vocabulary remains at my fingertips without relying on AI-driven code completion.

## ⚔️ The Protocol (Rules of Engagement)
To balance efficiency with learning, I follow a strict protocol for every solution in this repository:

### ✅ Permitted AI Usage (Documentation Tool)
*   **Syntax & Method Lookups:** I may use LLMs as a replacement for searching through documentation (e.g., *"What are the arguments for `map()`?"* or *"How do I use `itertools.groupby`?"*).
*   **Library Exploration:** Asking for names of modules or functions that might be relevant to a specific built-in Python feature.
*   **Clarification:** Explaining how a specific Pythonic construct (like a decorator or a generator) works under the hood.

### ❌ Prohibited AI Usage (No Solver)
*   **No Solution Generation:** I never ask the AI to "solve the problem" or "write a function that..."
*   **No Logic Hints:** I do not ask for the algorithmic approach or the "next step" in a solution.
*   **No Copy-Pasting:** Even if I lookup a method signature, every single character of the solution is typed out manually in my editor to rebuild muscle memory.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```text
.
├── 8-kyu/        # Beginner level - syntax basics
├── 7-kyu/        # Basic logic and string manipulation
├── 6-kyu/        # Core algorithms and functional programming
└── 5-kyu+/       # Advanced challenges
```

## 🛠 Self-Improvement Goals
*   **Syntactic Fluidity:** Getting back to the point where `zip`, `enumerate`, `map`, and `filter` feel like second nature.
*   **Independent Logic:** Strengthening the ability to break down complex problems without an AI "safety net."
*   **Standard Library Mastery:** Mastering `collections`, `itertools`, and `functools` through manual implementation.

### What changed:
1.  **"Permitted AI Usage":** Explicitly states that you use AI as a "high-speed documentation" tool for method signatures and library lookups.
2.  **"Prohibited AI Usage":** Clearly draws the line at logic, algorithmic hints, and code generation.
3.  **Philosophy Quote:** The closing quote now reflects your specific approach: *"I use AI to find the tools, but I build the solution with my own hands."*
